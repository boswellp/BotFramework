These files get you started with a Microsoft Bot Framework "Hello World" chatbot Heroku Node.

The app is based on the MBF document <a href="https://docs.botframework.com/en-us/node/builder/overview/">version</a> and an earlier SarahSays <a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/sarahsays/2016/06/01/microsoft-bot-framework-part-1/">version</a>.

One needs a Microsoft Account (I've had a Hotmail account since ages),then an <a href="https://portal.azure.com/">Azure Portal</a> account.

Then go to <a href="http://www.botframework.com"> and sign in with your Microsoft Account here, too. Register a bot. When you click Edit to edit the bot configuration, click "Manage Microsoft App and password" and make sure that the <a href="https://apps-dev.microsoft.com">Application Registration Portal</a> picks up your AppId.
